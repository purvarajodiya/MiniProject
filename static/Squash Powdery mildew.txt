Basics: Powdery mildew infections are caused by several different species of fungus. Each species has its own preferred host plants. The species of powdery mildew that affects squash foliage (Erysiphe cichoracearum) is different from those that target peas (Erysiphe pisi) or eggplants (Leveillula taurica).
 
Symptoms:t is one of the most common plant diseases, and because its appearance is so distinct, it’s fairly easy to identify. Powdery mildew  makes the leaves look like they’ve been dusted with talcum powder. The mildew is white to gray. Most of that white dust consists of spores which are easily carried by wind to other nearby leaves.

Cycle and Lethality:Powdery mildew is largely an aesthetic issue (meaning it makes the plants look not-so-good). However, a heavy layer of powdery mildew on squash leaves does affect their ability to photosynthesize and can, over time, affect the plant’s productivity and reduce yields. When severe, it will cause leaves to shrivel and die. These dead leaves can develop rot that can quickly spread to the crown of the plant.Powdery mildew on squash also can affect the plants resistance to other pests and diseases. When weakened by the disease, squash plants are more prone to issues with squash bugs, vine borers, botrytis, and other pests and diseases.

Organic Solutions: A better treatment solution for your squash plants is baking soda. Baking soda is an excellent option for treating powdery mildew. It is readily available in your home and will not cause any harm to the surrounding vegetable plants.
